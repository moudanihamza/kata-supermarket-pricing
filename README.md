# kata-supermarket-pricing
The problem domain is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at supermarkets.
 
Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. For example:
•     three for a dollar (so what’s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
•     $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
•     buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)
 
The exercise is to experiment with a model that is flexible enough to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes, and at the same time are generally usable how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions.
